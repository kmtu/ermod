slvfe.F90:

The slvfe.F90 program contained in the extensions directory has a key of ljlrc,
which enables the Lennard-Jones long-range correction at ljlrc = 'yes'
To use the slvfe.F90 program in extensions,
user simply does the followings in the parent directory of ermod.

$ mv slvfe.F90 slvfe_original.F90
$ mv extensions/slvfe.F90 ./
$ make
$ make install

Without stating ljlrc = 'yes' in parameters_fe,
the modified slvfe works just as in the same way as the original slvfe.

By setting ljlrc = 'yes' in parameters_fe, user is required to prepare a file
contaning the average volume of the reference solvent, read, for example, as

$ cat volumedata
30106.4

The volumedata file simpy has the average volume of the reference solvent
in Angstrom^3 unit; note that it not be given in nm^3.
If the volumedata file is not present, user is asked

write(6, *) " What is the average volume of reference solvent? (in Angstrom^3)"

and is to type the average volume in Angstrom^3 directly on terminal.

The difference between the original and modified slvfe.F90
is always updated in diff_slvfe in the extensions directory.

Caution: The Lennard-Jones long-range correction implemented in the program
can be used only when the solvent distribution function is homogeneous
(radial distribution function is essentially unity)
when the solvent molecule is separated beyond the Lennard-Jones cutoff distance
in any direction from any atom in the solute molecule.
The correction scheme may not be applied
when the solute/solvent molecule is comparable in size to or larger
than the cutoff radius, which is typically ~10 Angstrom,
or when the solvent is inhomogeneous in nanoscale
and, for example, is micelle or lipid membrane.
