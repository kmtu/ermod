The engproc.F90 contained in this directory
implements the method using the intermediate state introduced in Refs 1 and 2.

Ref 1: T. Kawakami, I. Shigemoto, and N. Matubayasi,
       J. Chem. Phys., 137, 234903 (9 pages) (2012) (see Appendix A).
Ref 2: S. Sakuraba and N. Matubayasi
       J Comp. Chem., 35, 1592-1608 (2014) (see Appendix C).

This method is a cure for treating a problematic low-energy tail if present.

To use the engproc.F90 program contained in this directory,
user simply does the followings in the parent directory of ERmod.

$ mv engproc.F90 engproc_original.F90
$ cp extensions/Intermediate/engproc.F90 ./
$ make
$ make install

To use the executable program of ermod,
there needs another section of "&intermediate" in parameters_er read as;

&ene_param
...
/
&hist
...
/
&intermediate
do_intermediate = 1
refs_filename = '../refs/engref'
/

do_intermediate and refs_filename are the variables
contained in the &intermediate section and will be described below.

As described in Appendix C of Ref 2,
the method with the intermediate state
is effective only for the solution system.
For the reference-solvent system, the outputs
from the ermod executable with the modified engproc.F90 in this directory
are actually identical to those from the original one
even when any values are set to do_intermediate and refs_filename
or when the section of &intermediate is absent.

For the solution system,
the ermod executable with the modified engproc.F90 in this directory
requires the presence of the &intermediate section in parameters_er.
Still, when do_intermediate is set to a value other than 1
or when the line of "do_intermediate = X" is not present,
the outputs from the modified ermod
are identical to those from the original one.

The method of intermediate state works only when do_intermediate = 1.
As noted in Appendix C of Ref 2,
the calculation of the reference-solvent system needs to be done
before that of the solution when the method of intermediate state is to be used.
The refs_filename parameter specifies
the filename for the one-body energy distribution in the reference solvent.
Its default value is '../refs/engref'
and can be modified within parameters_er
in accordance with user's output name convention for the reference solvent.

When the modified ermod executable is used for the solution system
at do_intermediate = 1,
there are addition outputs of Prob_Result, avint.tt, and engint.XX.
The other outputs are also produced from the run with the original ermod
and are identical between the modified and original ermod executables.

Prob_Result provides the free-energy change from the intermediate state
to the solution system of interest.
This free-energy change is \Delta G_2 in Appendix A of Ref 1
and \Delta \mu_2 in Appendix C of Ref 2.

The free-energy change from the reference solvent to the intermediate state
is denoted as \Delta G_1 in Appendix A of Ref 1
and \Delta \mu_1 in Appendix C of Ref 2.
To obtain this free-energy change, the slvfe executable is used by setting

slndnspf  = 'engint'
aveuvfile = 'avint.tt'

in parameters_fe (use does not need to set aveuvfile when uvread = 'not').
If user modifies the filenames of avint.tt and engint.XX,
the lines for slndnspf and aveuvfile in parameters_fe
need to be changed as such.

The resulting free energy of solvation is the sum of
the two free-energy changes computed above.
When this sum agrees well with the value from the original engproc.F90 program,
the problematic low-energy tail is in fact of no harm.
