version 0.3.alpha8 (04/10/2013)
* Solvation Free Energy:
    * Added dispersion correction on Lennard-Jones interaction in a modified
    slvfe.F90 program prepared in the extensions directory.

version 0.3.alpha7 (04/08/2013)
* Energy Histogram Computation:
    * The gromacs-type potential switch and the force switch for the LJ
    interaction is implemented with a new key of ljswitch.
* Misc:
    * A key of insstructure is introduced to select some solute structures
    according to its RMSD relative to the reference structure.
    * A procedure is defined which conducts a best-fit of
    the host (presumably protein) to the reference structure
    and inserts the solute (presumably ligand) within an given range of RMSD.

version 0.3.alpha6 (02/21/2013)
* Misc:
    * A snapshot can have its own weight; the weight information is saved in a
    separate file. The name of the file storing the weight is SysWght for the
    solution and for the solvent, and is SltWght for the isolated solute used
    for test-particle insertion. To activate the weight input, wgtsys = 1 in
    the case of SysWght and wgtins = 1 in the case of SltWght in
    parameters_er.

version 0.2.4 (02/13/2013)
* Misc:
    * There was a bug in case that the soln system contains more than one
    molecules for the solute species, and this bug is fixed
    * When the ermod program is used with an NAMD trajectory, it is no more
    necessary to prepare a .xst file. The cell information is directly read
    from the .dcd file and the file of HISTCELL linked to .xst file is not
    created by the gen_input script.

version 0.3.alpha5 (01/30/2013)
* Misc:
    * The ermod program does not output the self-energy distribution slfeng.XX
    at default. A key of selfcal is defined to output the self-energy
    distribution.
    * There was a bug in case that the soln system contains more than one
    molecules for the solute species, and this bug is fixed
    * When the ermod program is used with an NAMD trajectory, it is no more
    necessary to prepare a .xst file. The cell information is directly read
    from the .dcd file and the file of HISTCELL linked to .xst file is not
    created by the gen_input script.
    * The predetermined directories and filenames for the slvfe program is now
    flexible.

version 0.3.alpha4 (05/06/2012)
* Misc:
    * trajectory-formats/modylas.F90: Added I/O for Modylas MD package
    * mol_dissect: Fixed bugs with "save" command, reads PermIndex (so it now supports AMBER output), reads/writes sltpick

version 0.3.alpha3 (04/12/2012)
* Misc:
    * tools/AMBER/gen_input: --flexible is now abbreviated to -s.

version 0.3.alpha2 (03/19/2012)
* Parameters:
    * The specification for insertion configuration is rewritten with much more general setting.

version 0.2.3 (03/19/2012)
* General:
    * ERMOD is now licensed under GPL v2 or later.
* Install:
    * Fixed compilation problems on FX10 from Fujitsu.
