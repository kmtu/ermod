Files in this directory is examples to replace trajectory.F90.
If the user want to write a reader for new trajectory format which does not have VMD plugin, 
user should provide "trajectory" module, providing the following the type / subroutines:

* type(handle)
* subroutine open_trajectory
* subroutine close_trajectory
* subroutine read_trajectory

Simple example is dcd.f90, which can read CHARMM / NAMD dcd format.
If you want to write down new format, template_fortran.f90 is a good template to start on.
