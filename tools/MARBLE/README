The general workflow of using ERmod with MARBLE is parallel to
that described in the ERmod wiki page for NAMD, gromacs, and AMBER.

The gen_structure and gen_input scripts are available
in tools/MARBLE directory within the ERmod package distributed.
In the following, the directory containing
the gen_structure and gen_input scripts is denoted as "ERmod-MARBLE directory".


The gen_structure script runs as:

   (path to ERmod-MARBLE directory)/gen_structure --mdat solution.mdat

where solution.mdat is the topology file for the solution MD with MARBLE.
User specfifies his own topology file with the appropriate path.
He is then asked the identification number of the solute
and the number of solute molecules contained within the solution system.
If the solution system has more than one solute molecules,
the identification number needs to refer to the first one.
After executing the gen_structure script,
user has two directories of soln and refs.


ermod run in soln:
After moving to the soln directory, execute the gen_input script as:

   (path to ERmod-MARBLE directory)/gen_input --dcd solution-run.dcd --log solution-run.log

where solution-run.dcd and solution-run.log
are the trajectory and log files from the solution MD with MARBLE.
User specfifies his own files with the appropriate paths.
He can then run the ermod program to have the energy distribution functions.


ermod run in refs:
After moving to the refs directory, execute the gen_input script as:

   (path to ERmod-MARBLE directory)/gen_input --dcd solvent-run.dcd --log solvent-run.log --flexible solute-run.dcd

when the solute is flexible or as:

   (path to ERmod-MARBLE directory)/gen_input --dcd solvent-run.dcd --log solvent-run.log --rigid solute.pdb

when the solute is rigid,
where solvent-run.dcd and solvent-run.log
are the trajectory and log files from the reference-solvent MD with MARBLE,
solute-run.dcd is the trajectory file for the solute isolated in vacuum,
and solute.pdb is the PDB file for isolated solute.
User needs only one of solute-run.dcd and solute.pdb,
depending on whether his solute is flexible or rigid.

The MARBLE version of gen_input prepares an option of --inscfg.
It can be used as --inscfg tr&rot, --inscfg tr or --inscfg fix.
These set the inscfg parameter within paramters_er as
inscfg = 0, inscfg = 1, and inscfg = 2, respectively.
See http://sourceforge.net/p/ermod/wiki/parameters-ermod02
or http://sourceforge.net/p/ermod/wiki/parameters-ermod03
for the meaning of the inscfg parameter.

Further, the number of insertions per solvent configuration
in the refs calculation can be modifed with an option of --maxins.
For example, --maxins 500 in gen_input writes
maxins = 500 into the parameters_er file.
The default number of insertions is 1000.


The default format for output trajectory from MARBLE is DCD.
The ermod program can handle a DCD file without any special setting,
and when user has a trajectory file in DCD format,
he can run the ermod program without any modification.
MARBLE also has an option of writing the trajectory in text format.
When user adopts this option, he should visit
the trajectory-formats directory within the ERmod package distributed.
This directory has the marble.f90 file.
User needs to replace the trajectory.F90 by
   cp marble.f90 ../trajectory.F90
and re-compile the ERmod package through the standard procedure described at
https://sourceforge.net/p/ermod/wiki/build-Guide/.
See also https://sourceforge.net/p/ermod/wiki/SpecialTrajFormat/.
The ermod program can then handle a MARBLE trajectory in text format.
